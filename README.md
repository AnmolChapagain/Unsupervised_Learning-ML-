## Overview

Unsupervised learning aims to discover hidden patterns, structures, or groupings in data without relying on predefined labels. This project focuses on applying various unsupervised learning techniques, such as clustering (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, t-SNE), to better understand complex datasets.

The main objectives are:
- Preprocess and clean raw data for unsupervised analysis.
- Apply and compare multiple unsupervised algorithms.
- Visualize results and interpret discovered patterns.
- Offer reproducible workflows and modular code.
