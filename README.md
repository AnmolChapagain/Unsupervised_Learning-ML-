## Overview

Unsupervised learning aims to discover hidden patterns, structures, or groupings in data without relying on predefined labels. This project focuses on applying various unsupervised learning techniques, such as clustering (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, t-SNE), to better understand complex datasets.

The main objectives are:
- Preprocess and clean raw data for unsupervised analysis.
- Apply and compare multiple unsupervised algorithms.
- Visualize results and interpret discovered patterns.
- Offer reproducible workflows and modular code.

## Project Structure

## Key Features

- **Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:** Automated pipelines for cleaning, normalizing, and transforming data.
- **Clustering Algorithms:** Implementations and/or integrations of popular clustering methods (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN).
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Techniques like PCA, t-SNE, UMAP for high-dimensional data visualization and noise reduction.
- **Visualization:** Clear, interpretable plots and charts to help understand cluster structures and relationships.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Internal validation metrics (e.g., Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin) to guide model selection and parameter tuning.

## Data

**Note:** Datasets are not included by default due to size and licensing constraints. Please follow these steps:
1. Place your raw data files in `data/raw`.
2. Run the preprocessing scripts in `src/preprocessing` to generate cleaned, processed datasets in `data/processed`.

Example commands and instructions will be provided in `notebooks/` or the script docstrings.
